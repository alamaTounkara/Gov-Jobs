    <!-- this dimension name="widget_margin" is for default version the following purpose:
        As of Android 4.0, app widgets are automatically given padding between the widget frame and the
         app widget's bounding box to provide better alignment with other widgets and icons on the user's
          home screen. To take advantage of this strongly recommended behavior, set your application's
          targetSdkVersion to 14 or greater.

        It's easy to write a single layout that has custom margins applied for earlier versions of the
         platform, and has no extra margins for Android 4.0 and greater -->
    <dimen name="widget_margin">8dp</dimen>
